Healthcare Workflow Process Analysis
Introduction
This project analyzes healthcare workflow processes using data from the [Healthcare] database. It identifies operational strengths, areas for improvement, and offers actionable recommendations to enhance process efficiency, standardization, and compliance.

Key Findings
1. Process Volume by Workflow Type and Department
Six main workflows dominate:

Patient Admission (1,014 processes)

Billing Cycle (940)

Medication Dispensing (792)

Diagnostic Imaging (770)

Lab Testing (766)

Discharge Process (718)

Top departments by volume: Emergency (775), Laboratory (761), and Outpatient (758).

High-volume workflows significantly impact bottlenecks, automation, and compliance performance.

2. Process Time Analysis
Diagnostic Imaging has the longest average process time (~142 mins), followed by Discharge Process and Lab Testing (~138 mins each).

These workflows consume substantial resources and affect patient throughput.

3. Process Bottlenecks and Operational Hand-offs
Lab Testing and Patient Admission have the highest bottleneck rates and handoffs, indicating coordination challenges and potential delays.

4. Automation and SOP Compliance
Average automation score is moderate (~2.4), with opportunities to increase for more manual workflows like Billing Cycle and Lab Testing.

SOP compliance varies: higher in Lab Testing and Diagnostic Imaging; lower in Billing Cycle and Discharge Process, posing compliance risks.

5. Critical Process Outliers
The slowest processes are mostly in Lab Testing, Billing Cycle, and Discharge Process, associated with high bottlenecks and low automationâ€”urgent targets for improvement.

6. Risk Areas: SOP Gaps and Overdue Reviews
SOP non-compliance is widespread, impacting operational consistency and regulatory adherence.

Many workflows in Radiology, Inpatient, and Surgery have overdue reviews (>1 year), increasing risk from outdated procedures.

Recommendations
Targeted Process Optimization: Redesign high-volume, high-cycle-time workflows to reduce bottlenecks and improve throughput.

Increase Automation: Invest in tech solutions for manual-heavy workflows, especially Billing Cycle and Lab Testing.

Enforce SOP Compliance: Prioritize workflows with low adherence for compliance improvements.

Routine Process Review: Implement automated alerts to manage overdue reviews and maintain current best practices.

Departmental Training: Provide focused training to high-workload, low-compliance departments like Emergency, Laboratory, and Outpatient to boost effectiveness.
