📌 Introduction

This project analyzes healthcare workflow processes using data from the [Healthcare] database.
It identifies:

Operational strengths

Areas for improvement

Actionable recommendations to enhance efficiency, standardization, and compliance.

📊 Key Findings
1️⃣ Process Volume by Workflow Type & Department

Top Workflows (by process count):

Patient Admission – 1,014

Billing Cycle – 940

Medication Dispensing – 792

Diagnostic Imaging – 770

Lab Testing – 766

Discharge Process – 718

Top Departments (by volume):

Emergency – 775

Laboratory – 761

Outpatient – 758

💡 High-volume workflows are major drivers of bottlenecks, automation needs, and compliance performance.

2️⃣ Process Time Analysis

Longest average process times:

Diagnostic Imaging – ~142 mins

Discharge Process – ~138 mins

Lab Testing – ~138 mins

Long cycles reduce patient throughput and increase resource usage.

3️⃣ Bottlenecks & Operational Hand-offs

Highest bottleneck rates: Lab Testing, Patient Admission

High handoffs → greater coordination challenges and potential delays.

4️⃣ Automation & SOP Compliance

Average automation score: ~2.4 (moderate)

Manual-heavy workflows needing automation: Billing Cycle, Lab Testing

SOP compliance:

Higher in Lab Testing & Diagnostic Imaging

Lower in Billing Cycle & Discharge Process → compliance risks.

5️⃣ Critical Process Outliers

Slowest processes: Mostly in Lab Testing, Billing Cycle, Discharge Process.

These have high bottlenecks + low automation → urgent improvement targets.

6️⃣ Risk Areas: SOP Gaps & Overdue Reviews

SOP non-compliance is widespread → risks in operational consistency & regulatory adherence.

Departments with overdue reviews (>1 year): Radiology, Inpatient, Surgery.

💡 Recommendations

Targeted Process Optimization
Redesign high-volume, long-cycle workflows to reduce bottlenecks and improve throughput.

Increase Automation
Invest in solutions for manual-heavy workflows (Billing Cycle, Lab Testing).

Enforce SOP Compliance
Prioritize workflows with low adherence for compliance improvements.

Routine Process Review
Add automated alerts for overdue reviews to ensure procedures stay current.

Departmental Training
Focus on high-workload, low-compliance departments (Emergency, Laboratory, Outpatient).
